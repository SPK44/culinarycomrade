STEP 1: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 C). Peel and quarter potatoes, place them in a saucepan with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain, and mash with 1 teaspoon of the butter, and enough milk to reach your desired creaminess. Continue mashing, or beat with an electric mixer, until smooth. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

NOTE: This is a very versatile Indian curry sauce that can be served as a main course with meats and/or vegetabes or as a sauce for dipping or to spice up veggie side dishes. It's great over baked potatoes.

METHOD:

STEP 1: Heat oil and margarine in a small skillet or wok over medium high heat. Add chopped onion and saute until very brown, 10 to 15 minutes. (Note: This is an important step; if onion is not cooked well, sauce will taste funny.)

STEP 2: Add minced ginger and garlic to onion and saute for an additional 2 minutes. Process onion/ginger/garlic mixture in food processor until smooth. Do not rinse food processor.

STEP 3: Place onion mixture in large saucepan. Stir in the cinnamon, black pepper, coriander, cumin, turmeric and cayenne pepper and cook over low heat until mixture is thick and has the consistency of a paste. 

STEP 4: Puree tomatoes, chile peppers and cilantro in food processor until smooth. Add to onion mixture and stir well over low heat, cooking off moisture from tomatoes and cilantro. Add yogurt a little bit at a time, stirring constantly to avoid curdling.

STEP 5: Blend the whole mixture in food processor to puree it (for a very smooth sauce). Return to saucepan, add water and increase heat to high; bring to a rolling boil. Cover saucepan and boil for 3 to 5 minutes. Reduce heat and simmer until desired consistency is reached.

STEP 6: To serve with meat, cook the meat first separately, then simmer for 5 to 10 minutes in the sauce before serving over rice or with bread. To serve with vegetables, steam raw veggies first for 4 to 5 minutes, then simmer for 5 to 10 minutes in the sauce before serving.

METHOD:

STEP 1. For Marinade: In a large bowl, combine the wine, brandy, onions. carrots, parsley, one whole bay leaf, garlic, peppercorns and salt. Mix well and add the 2 pounds raw cubed beef. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for 2 days.

STEP 2: Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).

STEP 3: For Bourguignon: Strain the meat from the vegetables and marinade; reserve marinade. Dry meat with paper towels. Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add the meat and saute for 10 minutes, or until browned on all sides. Transfer meat to a separate medium bowl with a slotted spoon and set aside.

STEP 4: In the same skillet, add the bacon and saute until lightly browned. Transfer the bacon to the bowl with the meat. Drain the skillet and return it to the heat. Pour a cup of the marinade into the skillet to deglaze the skillet, scraping the bottom to loosen up all the little bits. Return this liquid to the reserved marinade.

STEP 5: Heat the remaining oil in the skillet. Add the onion and carrot from the marinade, along with the additional onion that you've chopped, and saute for 5 minutes, or until tender. Transfer this mixture to the bowl and the meat and bacon, again using a slotted spoon, and return skillet to the heat. Add the flour to the skillet, combining with the oil and stir until well mixed and brown, about 2 minutes.

STEP 6: Now add the tomato paste, garlic, beef broth, reserved marinade and salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a boil and whisk to remove any flour lumps. Add this to the meat and vegetable mixture. Place entire mixture into a 9x13 baking dish.

STEP 7: Bake at 300 degrees F (150 degrees C) for 3 hours, stirring occasionally and adding water as needed. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

STEP 8: About 15 minutes before meat is done baking, melt butter in the skillet over medium high heat. Add the sliced muchrooms and saute 5 to 10 minutes, or until lightly browned. When meat is done, add the mushrooms to the meat mixture, stir well and let sit for about 15 minutes.

Serve with potatoes, noodles or rice.

METHOD:

STEP 1: Heat the  oil in a medium skillet over low heat, and stir fry the thinly sliced shallots until browned and tender. Drain, reserving the oil, and set aside.

STEP 2: Place the chicken (cut into large pieces) in the reserved oil, and stir in the curry paste and curry powder to evenly coat. Pour in enough water to cover, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover skillet, and simmer until the chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear.

STEP 3: Stir in the coconut milk, tomato puree, fish sauce, palm sugar (1 tbs = 12 g), and 1/2 of the tomatoes (cut in wedges) into the skillet. Cook and stir over low heat until the mixture is smooth and creamy. Mix in the remaining tomato wedges, and continue cooking until tender. Top with the chopped cilantro and the fried shallots to serve.

NOTE: This recipe is good with steamed jasmine rice. It's quite a hot and spicy dish, so if you want it a bit mild, check the curry paste you use first. You can replace coconut milk with evaporated milk, but traditionally, coconut milk is a must.

METHOD:

STEP 1: In bowl, sir together dry sherry, sliced ginger root, oyster sauce, five-spice powder, soy sauce, white sugar, hoisin sauce, ketchup and cinnamon.

STEP 2: Cut pork into 5x2 inch strips. Place strips flat in a shallow baking dish. Pour marinade over pork strips. Let pork marinate at least 6 hours in refrigerator.

STEP 3: Drain, reserving marinade. Mix honey and 3 tablespoons reserved marinade in a small bowl; set aside. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

STEP 4: Fill a shallow roasting pan with water and place in botton of oven. Carefully place pork strips on a roasting rack above roasting pan so all sides are exposed to heat. If you don't have a roasting rack, insert the curved end of an S-shaped hook, paper clip, or drapery hook in pork strips and hang them from the top shelf.

STEP 5: Roast for 30 minutes. Baste pork strips with honey mixture. Roast 15 minutes and baste again. Roast 10 minutes longer or until pork strips are crisp and golden brown. Remove from oven and let cool.

NOTE 1: Serve at room temperature arranged in overlapping layers on a platter. Granish with cucumber slices, if desired.

NOTE 2: Hoisin sauce, also called Peking sauce, is a thick, reddish-brown sauce that is sweet and spicy, and widely used in Chinese cooking. It's a mixture of soybeans, garlic, chile peppers and various spices. It can be found in Asian markets and many large supermarkets. Look in the Asian or ethnic section. If this item is not in stock at your local store, ask your grocer to special order it for you. Most grocers will be happy to do this for their customers.

METHOD:

STEP 1: In a medium, non-reactive bowl, combine the chicken with 2 1/2 teaspoons of the white sugar, 1 1/2 tablespoons vinegar and 1/4 cup soy sauce. Mix this together and coat the chicken well. Cover and let marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour.

STEP 3: Cook the linguine pasta according to package directions, drain and set aside. Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a wok or large saucepan over high heat until it starts to smoke. Add the chicken and stir-fry for 4 to 5 minutes, or until browned. Transfer this and all juices to a warm plate.

STEP 4: Heat the remaining oil in the wok or pan over high heat. Add the ginger, garlic, mushrooms and sliced green onions, and stir-fry for 30 seconds. Add the reserved sauce mixture and then the chicken. Simmer until the sauce begins to thicken, about 2 minutes. Add the reserved noodles and toss gently, coating everything well with the sauce.

METHOD:

STEP 1: In a large bowl, blend hoisin sauce, cranberry sauce, soy sauce, white wine, honey, and 1/2 tsp red food coloring. Mix in garlic salt and Chinese five-spice powder. Place 4 lb raw  ribs in the mixture. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator at least 1 hour.

STEP 2: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

STEP 3: Place 2 cups water in bottom of a large roasting pan. Arrange ribs on pan rack, and cook 30 minutes in the preheated oven. Cover with remaining sauce mixture, and continue cooking 30 minutes, to an internal temperature of 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).

NOTE: Hoisin sauce, also called Peking sauce, is a thick, reddish-brown sauce that is sweet and spicy, and widely used in Chinese cooking. It's a mixture of soybeans, garlic, chile peppers and various spices. It can be found in Asian markets and many large supermarkets. Look in the Asian or ethnic section. If this item is not in stock at your local store, ask your grocer to special order it for you. Most grocers will be happy to do this for their customers.

METHOD:

STEP 1: Cut one whole eggplant into 3/4 inch slices. Sprinkle both sides of the eggplant slices with 1 1/2 tablespoons salt. Place slices in a colander, and place a dish underneath the colander to capture liquid that will sweat out of the eggplant. Allow to sit for 30 minutes.

STEP 2: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium bowl , mix the ricotta, mozzarella cheese and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Mix in the beaten egg and basil.

STEP 3: Rinse the eggplant in cold water until all salt is removed. In a large skillet, heat 4 tablespoons olive oil over medium heat. Place one layer of eggplant in the pan, brown each side. Repeat with remaining eggplant slices, using additional oil if necessary.

STEP 4: In a 9x13 inch baking dish, evenly spread 1 1/2 cups of spaghetti sauce. Arrange a single layer of eggplant slices on top of the sauce. Top the eggplant with 1/2 of the cheese mixture. Repeat layering process until all the eggplant and cheese mixture is used. Pour remaining sauce on top of layers, and sprinkle with remaining Parmesan cheese.

STEP 5: Bake 30 to 45 minutes in the preheated oven, until sauce is bubbly.

This makes a delicious entree served with a salad and garlic bread.

NOTE: As some of the 1 1/2 tabelspoons of salt is rinsed from the eggplant, only 1 tablespoon is used for the nutritional analysis.

NOTE: You can find lumpia wrappers in Asian food stores wherever they keep their frozen food.

METHOD:

STEP 1: Make sure the lumpia wrappers are completely thawed. Lay several out on a clean dry surface and cover with a damp towel. The wrapers are very thin and the edges will dry out quickly.

STEP 2: In a medium bowl, blend together the ground beef and pork, chopped onion, green pepper, and carrot. Place about 2 tablespoons of the meat mixture along the center of the wrapper. The filling should be no bigger around than your thumb or the wrapper will burn before the meat is cooked. Fold one edge of wrapper over to the other. Fold the outer edges in slightly, then continue to roll into a cylinder. Wet your finger, and moisten the edge to seal. Repeat with the remaining wrappers and filling, keeping finished lumpias covered to prevent drying. This is a good time to recruit a friend or loved one to make the job less repetitive!

STEP 3: Heat 1 quart oil in a 9 inch skillet at medium to medium high heat until oil is 365 to 375 degrees F (170 to 175 degrees C). Fry 3-4 lumpia at a time. It should only take 2-3 minutes for each side. The lumpia will be nicely browned when done. Drain on paper towels.

STEP 4: You can cut each lumpia into thirds for parties, if you like. In the Phillippines, lumpia was eaten with banana ketchup, but I've never seen it sold in America.

Editor's Note: We have determined the nutritional value of oil for frying based on a retention value of 10% after cooking. The exact amount may vary depending on cook time and temperature, ingredient density, and the specific type of oil used.

NOTE: Can be served either as a main course, or a delicious appetizer.

METHOD:

STEP 1: In a large saucepan over medium heat, place chicken (cut into pieces), potato, onion and peeled carrot. Pour in water, and bring to a boil. Skim any foam from the surface, and season with 1 1/2 teaspoons salt. Reduce heat, and simmer for 1 hour, or until chicken and vegetables are tender. Strain and reserve broth. Discard vegetables. Allow chicken to cool, then remove skin and bones, and shred meat into very small pieces.

STEP 2: Remove crusts from two 1-inch thick slices stale French bread. Soften the bread in some of the chicken broth, then squeeze out. In a large bowl, combine bread, ground walnuts, crushed garlic, red pepper, and 1 teaspoon salt. Using your hands, mix well like you're mixing meatballs. Place mixture in cheesecloth, and squeeze oil that the ground walnuts produce into a small bowl; set aside. Place walnut mixture into large bowl. Slowly blend in 1 cup of reserved chicken broth until consistency is like thick soup.

STEP 3: Place shredded chicken in a porcelain or glass serving dish. Stir in 2 to 3 tablespoons of walnut mixture. Cover chicken with remaining walnut mixture so the chicken is not visible. Smooth surface with the back of a spoon. Pour reserved walnut oil over the top.

NOTE: This is a homemade spaghetti meat sauce passed down to 4 generations of Sicilians. Fresh tomatoes can be put in the place of the puree but not recommended, due to the high acidity of the fresh tomatoes.

METHOD:

STEP 1: Heat olive oil in a large stock pot over medium heat. Saute diced onions, and minced garlic until lightly browned. Place pork shoulder in pot, and pour in 1/2 cup white wine and 3 cups water. In a small bowl, combine oregano, parsley, thyme, rosemary, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Sprinkle 1/4 of spice mixture over pork. Cover, and cook for 30 minutes, turning occasionally. Add water periodically if needed.

STEP 2: Pour in tomato puree. Fill cans with water, and pour in (about 6 cups). Stir in remaining spice mixture and the sugar. When liquid starts to bubble, reduce heat to low, cover, and cook for 4 to 5 hours. Stir occasionally, and adjust seasonings to taste.

METHOD:

STEP 1: In a large non-stick pot over high heat, brown 1 lb raw ground beef until no pink shows. Stir in chopped onion and finely chopped jalapeno, and cook until tender. Season with curry powder. Stir in chicken broth and tomato sauce. Bring to a boil, and stir in green beans. Cook for 15 minutes, or until beans are tender.

STEP 2: Stir in rice, and cover pot. Reduce heat to medium, and cook for 10 to 15 minutes, or until much of the liquid is absorbed. (Be careful not to overcook rice at this point or the dish will be mushy; the rice should be firm.) Remove entire contents to another container, and return pot to the stove.

STEP 3: Heat oil in the bottom of pot over medium heat (make sure it is a non-stick pot). Dump rice mixture back into pot. Wrap a clean dish towel around the inside of the pot's lid (the ends of the dish towel will be folded over the edges on the top of the lid), and put the lid on the pot. Cook for 35 minutes, without uncovering or stirring. Remove lid and place a tray on top of the pot, then carefully flip it over. The rice will hold the shape of the pot with a nice crust on top call 'tah digh.'

NOTE: Serve with plain yogurt and a salad to mix with the rice dish.

METHOD:

STEP 1: Place chicken (cut into pieces) in a large pot with 6 cups water, quartered onion, 2 tablespoons allspice, ground cardamon, 3 whole cardamon seeds, 4 whole cloves and 3 bay leaves. Bring to a boil, and cook until chicken is tender, about 40 minutes. Remove chicken, strain and reserve broth.

STEP 2: Rinse and drain the rice. Then soak the rice in water while waiting for the chicken to cook. When the chicken is almost done, drain the water off, and stir in 1 1/2 tablespoons of allspice.

STEP 3: Heat the oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Fry the sliced potato rounds and cauliflower (separated into florets) in the hot oil until browned. They do not need to fully cook.

STEP 4: In a separate pot, layer fried potatoes on the bottom. This is done so that the rice will not stick to the bottom of the pan. Add the cauliflower and tomatoes, and sprinkle a handful of rice over the vegetables. Remove the bones from the chicken and place the chicken in the pot. Cover with the rest of the rice. Pour in the reserved broth until it reaches a level about 1/2 inch above the level of the rice. Cover the pot, and cook over medium-low heat for 1 hour, until rice is tender.

STEP 5: When the liquid has absorbed, have a large round tray ready. Uncover the pot, and place the tray over the top. Invert so that the pan is upside down on top of the tray. Let stand for 5 minutes like this, then slowly remove the pot to let the food fall onto the tray.

NOTE: You may substitute 1 large eggplant for cauliflower or use both. Slice eggplant in rounds, cut larger pieces in half. If using eggplant with the cauliflower, add it to the pot along with the cauliflower.

NOTE: Can be served with plum sauce as well as a fruit sauce. This is actually a short-cut version but it is fantastic.

METHOD:

STEP 1: Rinse the duck inside and out, and pat dry. Cut off tail and discard. In a small bowl, mix together the cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, white pepper and cloves. Sprinkle one teaspoon of the mixture into the cavity of the duck. Stir one tablespoon of the soy sauce into the remaining spice mixture and rub evenly over the entire outside of the bird. Cut one of the green onions in half and tuck into the cavity. Cover and refrigerate the bird for at least 2 hours, or overnight.

STEP 2: Place duck breast side up on a rack in a big enough wok or pot and steam for an hour adding a little more water, if necessary, as it evaporates. Lift duck with two large spoons, and drain juices and green onion.

STEP 3: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place duck breast side up in a roasting pan and prick skin all over using a fork.

STEP 4: Roast for 30 minutes in the preheated oven. While the duck is roasting, mix together the remaining 2 tablespoons of soy sauce and honey. After 30 minutes, brush the honey mixture onto the duck and return it to the oven. Turn the heat up to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Roast for 5 minutes, or until the skin is richly browned. Do not allow the skin to char.

STEP 5: Prepare the duck sauce by mixing the plum jam with the sugar, vinegar and chutney in a small serving bowl. Chop remaining green onions and place them in a separate bowl. Place whole duck onto a serving platter and garnish with orange slices and fresh parsley. Use plum sauce and onions for dipping.

NOTE: The pork can be substituted with either chicken or beef. Served with refried beans and a salad.

METHOD:

Tamale Filling:
STEP 1: Place pork into a Dutch oven with the halved onion and garlic, and add water to cover. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer until the meat is cooked through, about 2 hours.

STEP 2: Use rubber gloves to remove stems and seeds from the chile pods. Place chiles in a sauce pan with 2 cups water. Simmer, uncovered, for 20 minutes, then remove from heat to cool. Transfer the chiles and water to a blender and blend until smooth. Strain the mixture, stir in salt, and set aside. Shred the cooked meat and mix in one cup of the chile sauce.

STEP 3: Soak the corn husks (18 oz pkg)  in a bowl of warm water. 

Tamake Dough:
STEP 4:
In a large bowl, beat the lard with a tablespoon of the broth until fluffy. Combine the masa harina, baking powder and salt; stir into the lard mixture, adding more broth as necessary to form a spongy dough.

STEP 5: Spread the dough out over the corn husks to 1/4 to 1/2 inch thickness. Place one tablespoon of the meat filling into the center. Fold the sides of the husks in toward the center and place in a steamer. Steam for 1 hour.

STEP 6: Remove tamales from husks and drizzle remaining chile sauce over. Top with sour cream. For a creamy sauce, mix sour cream into the chile sauce.

METHOD:

STEP 1: Combine the water and milk in a medium size pot or saucepan, heat to a simmer. Keep the pan over low heat.

STEP 2: Melt the butter in a large casserole or skillet over medium high heat. Add the minced onion and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the minced garlic and rice, stir constantly for 1 minute. Add the white wine and stir until completely absorbed.

STEP 3: Begin to add the heated milk-water mixture 1/2 cup at a time, stirring frequently. Wait until each addition is almost completely absorbed before adding the next. When the rice has cooked for 15 minutes and most of the liquid has been incorporated, add the corn kernels and tomatoes (peeled, seeded and chopped) along with the end of the milk-water mixture. Cook, stirring frequently, until the rice is tender but still slightly chewy.

STEP 4: The risotto should take 18 to 20 minutes of cooking all together. Stir in the Parmesan cheese, most of the basil, and the salt and pepper. Spoon the risotto immediately onto plates, top with the remaining basil strands, and serve.

NOTE: Nutritional analysis does not include oil that may be absorbed if wontons are fried.

METHOD:

STEP 1: In a large bowl, combine coarsely chopped pork, peeled and finely chopped shrimp, sugar, wine, soy sauce, 1 teaspoon chopped green onions and chopped ginger. Blend well, and let stand for 25 to 30 minutes.

STEP 2: Place about one teaspoon of the filling at the center of each wonton skin. Moisten all 4 edges of wonton wrapper with water, then pull the top corner down to the bottom, folding the wrapper over the filling to make a triangle. Press edges firmily to make a seal. Bring left and right corners together above the filling. Overlap the tips of these corners, moisten with water and press together. Contine until all wrappers are used.

STEP 3: FOR SOUP: Bring the chicken stock to a rolling boil. Drop wontons in, and cook for 5 minutes. Garnish with chopped green onion and serve.

NOTES: Uncooked wontons will keep in freezer for 2 months if well wrapped. Thaw before frying, but they can be boiled straight from frozen and cooked 2 minutes longer.
TO FRY: Heat 2 to 3 cups of oil in a wok until hot. Deep-fry wontons in batches until golden, 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Drain. Serve with dipping sauce or duck sauce, also called plum sauce.
