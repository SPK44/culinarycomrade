METHOD:

STEP 1:
Sift together flour and salt into mixer bowl.
STEP 2:
Add shortening to dry ingredients.  Using pastry knife attachment, mix at low speed 30 seconds or until shortening is evenly distributed and mixture is granular in appearance.
STEP 3:
Add cold water (40°F. to 50°F.); mix at low speed 1 minute until dough is just formed.
STEP 4:
Chill dough at least 1 hour for ease in handling.
STEP 5 - MAKING TWO-CRUST PIES:
1.  PREPARE AND DIVIDE DOUGH:  Prepare one recipe of Pie Crust for 2-Crust Pies.  Divide dough into 13 - 7½ oz pieces for bottom crust and 13 - 7 oz pieces for top crust; place on lightly floured board.
2.  ROLL DOUGH:  Sprinkle each piece of dough lightly with flour; flatten gently.  Using a floured rolling pin, roll lightly with quick strokes from center out to edge in all directions.  Form a circle 1 inch larger than pie pan and about 1/8 inch thick.  Bottom crust will be slightly thicker.  Shift or turn dough occasionally to prevent sticking.  If edges split, pinch cracks together.
3.  BOTTON CRUST:  Fold rolled dough in half; carefully place into ungreased pie pan with fold at center.  Unfold and fit carefully into pie pan, being careful not to leave any air spaces between pan and dough.
4.  FULL CRUST:  Fill as specified on idividual recipe card.
5.  TOP CRUST:  Roll top crust in same manner as bottom crust.  Fold in half; with knife, make several small slits near center fold to allow steam to escape during baking.  Brush
outer rim of bottom crust with water.  Lay top crust over filling with fold at center; unfold and press edges of two crusts together lightly.
6.  REMOVE EXCESS DOUGH:  Trim overhanging edges of dough by using a knife or spatula.  (Incorporate excess dough into next crust, if needed.)  There should be little excess if skill is used in weighing and rolling dough.
7.  SEAL PIE:  Press edges of crust firmly together or crimp with the thumb and forefinger to make a fluted edge.
8.  WASHED TOP:  For a washed top, brush pies with appropriate wash as follows:
     -Egg and Milk Wash- This wash is used for fruit pies    (apple,  blueberry, cherry, peach, pineapple) that are baked 30 to 35 minutes.  It SHOULD NOT be used for pies requiring longer baking time as the crust will brown excessively.  See Recipe No. I-4.
      -Egg and Water Wash- This wash is used for berry and mincemeat pies that are baked 40 to 45 minutes.  It SHOULD NOT be used for pies that are baked 30 to 35 minutes as the crusts will be too pale.  Allow glaze to dry on crust before baking to eliminate dark spots.  See Recipe No. I-4-1.
9.  BAKE:  Bake as specified on individual recipe card.

NOTE:
Pie crust mix may be used.  Omit Steps 1 through 3.  Follow manufacturer's directions for preparation.  Follow Steps 4 and 5. Quantity of pie crust mix required:  10 lb pie crust mix yields 13-two crust pies.

NOTE:

1.  GUIDELINES FOR USE OF STEAM COOKERS:  

Use of steamers in quantity food preparation can save cooking time, labor, help maintain appearance of food, and preseve nutrients normally lost by other cooking methods.  Seamers are ideal for batch preparation.  Food may be steamed and served in the same pan, if steam table pans are used for preparation.

Steamers are either 5 lb pressure or 15 lb pressure (high speed) type.  When food is steamed at 5 lb pressure, the internal temperature of the steamer is 225°F. to 228°F.  At 15 lb pressure, the temperature is 245°F. to 250°F.

Most fresh or frozen vegetables, in additoin to other foods such as rice, pasta, poultry, meats, fish, and shellfish can be cooked in steamers.  Canned vegetables also can be quickly heated in steamers.  

Foods may be steamed in perforated or solid pans.  Perforated pans are usually used, particularly for vegetables, unless the cooking liquid is retained or manufacturer's directions specify solid type pans.  Pans are normally filled no more than 2/3 full to allow steam to circulate for even cooking.

Cooking times will vary depending on the type steamer, food, and temperature and quantity of the product.  For best results follow the manufacturer's cooking times and directions.  Cooking time should be scheduled to include bringing food up to cooking temperature, as well as steaming time.  TIMING BEGINS when the pressure gauge registers 3 lb on the 5 lb steamer and 9 lb on the 15 lb steamer.  Be sure to USE TIMER, IF AVAILABLE, TO PREVENT OVERCOOKING.

After cooking is completed, the steam should be exhausted slowly for safety and to preserve skins of vegetables such as peas.  Leave steamer doors ajar for cooling and to preserve door gaskets.

GUIDELINES FOR SANDWICH PREPARATION:
Sandwiches may be served hot or cold, closed or open-faced. Variation in the bread and rolls will provide variety in flavor, texture, size and shape.  Enriched white rye, whole wheat, pumpernickel, French, raisin, and Italian breads, plus hot dog, hamburger, soft and hard rolls, English muffins, and pita bread can be used in sandwiches.  Bread with a relatively firm texture makes good sandwiches for eating out-of-hand without bending or losing filling.
PRE-PREPARATION:
1.  Have sandwich counter, tools, and equipment clean and sanitary.
2.  Following recipe card, have all ingredients ready to use:
     -  Wash lettuce thoroughly; core, separate leaves, drain,         and crisp.
     -  Evenly slice foods such as tomatoes, cheese, and                 meats.  Cross-stack sliced ingredients such as cheese            and meat for quick and easy pickup.
    -  Prepare mixed sandwich fillings.
3.  Allow plenty of space of work.
4.  Assemble all equipment and ingredients in advance, and place within easy reach toward back of work space.
5.  Arrange ingredients in the order to be used.

2.  In Step 1, 24 lb corned beef will yield about 16 lb cooked corned beef.
3.  In Step 1, 16 lb precooked frozen corned beef may be used.  Thaw.
4.  In Step 2, 4 lb 5 oz fresh lettuce A.P. will yield 4 lb trimmed lettuce.
5.  In Step 2, 13 lb 8 oz round top sliced bread may be used for sandwich sliced bread.
6.  Other types of bread may be used.

VARIATION:

GUIDELINES FOR SANDWICH PREPARATION:
Sandwiches may be served hot or cold, closed or open-faced. Variation in the bread and rolls will provide variety in flavor, texture, size and shape.  Enriched white,rye, whole wheat, pumpernickel, French, raisin, and Italian breads, plus hot dog, hamburger, soft and hard rolls, English muffins, and pita bread can be used in sandwiches.  Bread with a relatively firm texture makes good sandwiches for eating out-of-hand without bending or losing filling.
PRE-PREPARATION:
1.  Have sandwich counter, tools, and equipment clean and sanitary.
2.  Following recipe card, have all ingredients ready to use:
  -  Wash lettuce thoroughly; core, separate leaves, drain, and crisp.
  -  Evenly slice foods such as tomatoes, cheese, and meats.  Cross-stack sliced ingredients such as cheese and meat         for quick and easy pickup.
  -  Prepare mixed sandwich filling.
3.  Allow plenty of space to work.
4.  Assemble all equipment and ingredients in advance, and place within easy reach toward back of work space.
5.  Arrange ingredients in the order to be used.

2.  In Step 1, 25 lb French bread can be used for rolls.  In Step 4, cut each loaf in 4 pieces.
3.  In Step 2, suggested meats are sliced ham, bologna, pickle and pimiento loaf, and salami.
4.  In Step 2, American, Swiss, Monterey Jack or Cheddar cheese, or a combination of these may be used.
5.  In Step 2, 11 lb 6 oz fresh tomatoes A.P. will yield 11 lb 2 oz thinly sliced tomatoes; 3 lb 4 oz fresh lettuce A.P. will yield 3 lb shredded lettuce.

VARIATION:

1.  ITALIAN STYLE SUBMARINE:  In Step 1, omit Salad Dressing.  In Step 2, use 10 lb 6 oz (200 slices) thinly sliced Provolone cheese.  In Step 3, mix 1 lb 8 oz (3 cups) salad oil or olive oil with 1 cup vinegar; sprinkle over lettuce.  If desired, 1-2/3 oz (10 tbsp) crushed oregano and 2 lb (1½ qt) thinly sliced dry onions (2 lb 4 oz A.P.) may be used.  Combine oregano with salad oil or olive oil and vinegar.  In Step 3, sprinkle salad oil mixture and onions lightly on top of lettuce.

GUIDELINES FOR SANDWICH PREPARATION:
Sandwiches may be served hot or cold, closed or open-faced. Variation in the bread and rolls will provide variety in flavor, texture, size, and shape.  Enriched white, rye, whole wheat, pumpernickel, French, raisin, and Italian breads, plus hot dog, hamburger, soft and hard rolls, English muffins, and pita bread can be used in sandwiches.  Bread with a relatively firm texture makes good sandwiches for eating out-of-hand without bending or losing filling.
PRE-PREPARATION:
1.  Have sandwich counter, tools, and equipment clean and sanitary.
2.  Following recipe card, have all ingredients ready to use:
-  Wash lettuce thoroughly; core, separate leaves, drain and   crisp.
-  Evenly slice foods such as tomatoes, cheese, and meats.    Cross-stack slided ingredients such as cheese and meat for    quick and easy pickup.
-  Prepare mixed sandwich fillings.
3.  Allow plenty of space to work.
4.  Assemble all equipment and ingredients in advance, and place within easy reach toward back of work space.
5.  Arrange ingredients in the order to be used.

2:  In Step 1, 13 lb 8 oz round top sliced bread may be used for sandwich sliced bread.
3.  Other types of bread may be used.
4.  In Step 2:  
-  4 lb 5 oz fresh lettuce A.P. will yield 4 lb trimmed lettuce.
-  11 lb 6 oz fresh tomatoes A.P. will yield 11 lb 2 oz thinly        sliced tomatoes.
-  1 lb 4 oz dry onions A.P. will yield 2 lb thinly sliced onions.
