# culinarycomrade

As part of a Software Engineering Class, we as a group of 5 URI Students had to work together to design, demonstate, build, and test a product which we envisioned. We did this as part of a regular class, over one semester

In order to better illustrate this project, we created [an SRS document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FaL6MFByW74c7uw-zYuAeHiFxVEc2jfVRDCIDu15khA). As a breif overview, the purpose of this application will be to help the user figure out what he/she can cook when the user enters the ingredients he/she has at home into the application. The application will also allow the user to browse a database of recipes and if the user would like to cook a meal using one of the recipes, the application can create a shopping list with the ingredients that is required to cook the meal.
